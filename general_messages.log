Unbread#0683: there should only be 3 test cases if we did the logic she was talking about in the assignment solutions
Unbread#0683: WHY
balaur20#4458: Idk but I'm pretty sure we should follow her assignments since its the only thing she's actually grading
Unbread#0683: yes, agreed...

Lutaal#4809: So I‚Äôm having trouble motivating myself to aim for that A when getting a B is a guarantee
